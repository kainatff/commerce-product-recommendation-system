Customer-Product Recommendation System

Overview:
The Customer-Product Recommendation System is a machine learning-based solution designed to suggest relevant products to customers. It utilizes a bipartite graph structure and cosine similarity to analyze relationships between customers and products, optimizing recommendations based on user behavior.

 Features
- Bipartite Graph Representation: Models customer-product interactions as a bipartite graph.
- Cosine Similarity: Computes similarity scores to recommend relevant products.
- Performance Evaluation: Assesses system effectiveness using precision, recall, and F1-score.
- Customer Behavior Analysis: Provides insights to improve recommendation accuracy.

 Technologies Used
- Python: Primary programming language.
- Bipartite Graphs: Used for representing customer-product relationships.
- Cosine Similarity: Measures similarity between users and products.
- Machine Learning: Applies statistical techniques for recommendation.

 Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/kainatff/commerce-product-recommendation-system.git
   cd customer-product-recommendation
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```sh
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

 Usage
1. Prepare the dataset with customer-product interactions.
2. Run the recommendation system:
   ```sh
   python recommender.py
   ```

 Evaluation Metrics
- Precision: Measures the accuracy of recommended products.
- Recall: Evaluates the proportion of relevant products recommended.
- F1-score: Balances precision and recall for overall performance assessment.
